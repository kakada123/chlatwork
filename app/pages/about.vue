      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Privacy-first approach</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Many ChlatWork tools are designed to run directly in your browser. When
        a tool can work locally, your files stay on your device and are not
        uploaded to a server.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Some tools may require a server (for example: link shortening). In those
        cases, we keep data collection minimal and explain it in our Privacy
        Policy.
