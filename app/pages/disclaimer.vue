      <p class="text-gray-700">
        You are responsible for verifying any output before using it in
        production, printing, payments, inventory, or business workflows. For
        example: barcodes, QR codes, converted files, and formatted text should

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">File handling & privacy</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Many tools are designed to run directly in your browser, meaning your
        files can stay on your device. However, some tools may require a server
        component to function. When server processing is required, we aim to
        minimize data collection and handle data only for the purpose of
        providing the feature.
